					Communities exist all around us. The school you go to, the neighbourhood where you live in, the places you travel to, these are all full of communities. Simply put, a community is a group of people who have something in common. This something can vary, from playing videogames to having the same socioeconomic background.

					From this broad definition you can deduce that some communities are more positive than others. For example, belonging to a community bonded by arguments and insults has a negative effect on our health compared to a community full of motivation and encouragement. This sounds straightforward, but what are the characteristics that separate a positive community from a negative one? The first is to have common positive goals. Having a common goal to accomplish unites your community and allows for the growth of its members individually and as a group. Another crucial element of a positive community is to take care of each member. Is someone feeling off? Ask them and try to improve their situation. Is a situation unfair? Fight against that unfairness.

					Although it might seem like your contribution won’t help, especially in big communities, every small effort you do to improve your communities counts. Organising a fundraiser or volunteering to achieve a common goal can be a great way to improve a community but may seem daunting at first. If you’re not comfortable organising big events, small things like helping someone in your community can go a long way to improve their wellbeing.				</p>
